# Formatting and Language

Formatting and appropriate language are the basic design elements of all technical documents.  A format that shows a hierarchical structure and a coordinate structure of information leads the reader through the text.  Using appropriate language is significant in providing the reader with a thorough understanding of the purpose of the documents, how the document relates to the reader’s needs, and what action is expected of the reader.

# Academic Writing versus Technical Writing

The definite purpose, strict format, and use of appropriate language in technical writing define the differences between technical writing and academic writing.  The academic writer’s purpose may be to write an assignment, a story, a letter, etc.. These works may or may not have a reader. However, technical writing always has a definite purpose and will always have a reader.  Regardless of the number of the intended readers of a document who may or may not read the document, the document will be read by the primary reader.

# Cultural Communication

Technical writers need to be aware of the differences within and between the behaviors, norms, beliefs, and values of specific cultural environments.  According to Edward T. Hall and Mildred Reed Hall, In Understanding Cultural Differences, each culture operates according to its own rules (1990, pp. 3-4).  Hall and Hall add that problems occur when members of one culture apply their rules to another culture (1990, pp. 3-4). To communicate effectively with other cultures, the technical writer needs to not only be aware of rules governing behaviors that can be observed but also of the not-so-obvious rules that govern the norms, beliefs, and values of the people of a culture. The invisible rules of a culture dramatically impact the acceptance of ideas, plans, and strategies.  The Cultural Iceberg illustrates patterns of world communication, showing indicators of Institutional Culture (the obvious behavior of a culture), which can be clearly seen as the tip of the iceberg, and People Culture (the norms, beliefs and values of a culture), which cannot be seen and which are the barriers to successful communication.

# Step 5: Manage your invoices and payment methods 

Before you start working with resources in your account, familiarize yourself with where you can manage your payment method and access your invoices.

## Managing your payment method
- To manage your payment method for an account that's billed in USD currency, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select Payments.
- To manage your payment method for an account that's billed in non-USD currency, go to IBM Billing.

## Accessing your invoices
- To access an invoice for an account that's billed in USD currency, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select **Invoices**.
- To access an invoice for an account that's billed in non-USD currency, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select **Invoices**. Then, click **IBM Invoices**.

# Step 7: Create your resource groups 

Resource groups provide a way for you to easily manage access to multiple resources and to view billage usage for a set of resources. With your Pay-As-You-Go account, you can create more resource groups in addition to the default resource group that's included when you first created your Lite account.

1. Go to **Manage > Account > Account resources > Resource groups**.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Enter a name for your resource group, and click **Add**.
[See What makes a good resource group strategy?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account_setup#resource-group-strategy) for details about how to optimally organize resources in your resource groups.

# Step 9: Invite users to your account 

You're ready to invite users to your account and grant them access based on the resources they will work with and the tasks they'll perform. If you want users to create resources from the catalog and assign the resources to a resource group, the following access is required:

- Viewer role or higher on the resource group.
- Editor or administrator role on the service.

Complete the following steps:

1. Go to **Manage > Access (IAM) > Users**.
2. Click **Invite users**.
3. Specify the email address of the user. If you are inviting more than one user, they are all assigned the same access.
4. Add the user to one or more of the access groups that you created in the previous step.
5. Click **Invite**.
